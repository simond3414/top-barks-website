    {
      "question": "What training methods do you use?",
      "answer": "I use reward-based, force-free training methods that are kind, fair, and effective. This includes clicker training and positive reinforcement techniques based on modern learning theory and scientific research. All methods are in keeping with the APDT's principles of kind, fair, and effective training."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where do training sessions take place?",
      "answer": "Most training sessions are held in your own home where your dog is most comfortable. This allows us to address real-life situations in your dog's natural environment. For certain services like gundog training, we may work in outdoor locations. I cover York and the surrounding North Yorkshire area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long are the training sessions?",
      "answer": "Standard training sessions last one hour. This gives us enough time to work on training exercises while keeping your dog engaged and focused. For behaviour consultations, an initial 2-hour session is recommended to thoroughly assess and address issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What qualifications do you have?",
      "answer": "I hold a BSc Hons in Canine Behaviour and Training from the University of Hull (first man in the UK to gain this qualification), an FdSc in Canine Behaviour and Training, COAPE Think Dog qualification, and CAP 2 (clicker training competency). I'm also a full accredited member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers (MAPDT 09777)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer group classes?",
      "answer": "I specialise in one-to-one training rather than group classes. Individual sessions allow us to focus entirely on your dog's specific needs, work at your dog's pace, and schedule sessions at times that suit you. Training in your home also means your dog learns in their natural environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas do you cover?",
      "answer": "I'm based in Huntington, York, and primarily cover York and the surrounding North Yorkshire area within a reasonable radius. Other areas may be covered by arrangement - please contact me for a quote if you're outside the York area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I book a session?",
      "answer": "You can book a session by calling me on 01904 62 91 86 or 07932 63 28 55, emailing mark@topbarks.co.uk, or using the contact form on this website. I'll discuss your needs and arrange a time that suits you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is your cancellation policy?",
      "answer": "I understand that circumstances can change. Please provide at least 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule a session. This allows me to offer the slot to another client. Repeated cancellations may result in forfeiture of that session."
